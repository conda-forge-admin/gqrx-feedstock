  summary: Software defined radio receiver powered by GNU Radio and Qt
  description: |
    Gqrx is an open source software defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented using GNU
    Radio and the Qt GUI toolkit. Currently it works on Linux and Mac with hardware
    supported by gr-osmosdr, including Funcube Dongle, RTL-SDR, Airspy, HackRF,
    BladeRF, RFSpace, USRP and SoapySDR.

    Gqrx can operate as an AM/FM/SSB receiver with audio output or as an FFT-only
    instrument. There are also various hooks for interacting with external application
    using network sockets.
